Hey I'm Diego or [SanicSquirtle420](https://www.github.com/sanicsquirtle420) !

This is my Github account mostly to store my [dotfiles](https://www.github.com/sanicsquirtle420/dotfiles) and any other Linux projects I have been working on. Apart from my Linux experiments, I will be having my Python experiments in here to have them stored in a safe space.
