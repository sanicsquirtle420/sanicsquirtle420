Hey I'm @sanicsquirtle420 !
This is my Github account mostly to store my dotfiles (https://www.github.com/sanicsquirtle420/dotfiles) and any other linux projects I have been working on. Apart from my linux experiments, I will be having my python experiments in here to have them stored in a safe space.
